# Gerald the Hermit Crab

**Gerald the Hermit Crab** is a simple platformer that was developed as a class project. Please note that due to the short development time, the code might contain bugs, lack optimization, and be somewhat messy. The game offers the following features:

- **Basic Platforming**: The player can move left, right, and jump across platforms. A dynamic camera smoothly follows the player throughout the level.
- **Custom Physics Engine**: Entities collide with the environment and each other. All physics is coded from scratch; no external physics library is used.
- **Mario-like Combat**: Players can defeat enemies by jumping on their heads, and enemies kill the player upon other forms of contact.
- **Animation and Music**: All characters and entities in the game are fully animated, and there is background music and sound effects.
